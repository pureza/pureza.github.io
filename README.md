## Wheels for Staircases

URL: http://pureza.github.io/app/

This is a JavaScript animation showing how one could *theoretically* shape wheels tailored to climb or descend staircases smoothly, without bumps.

There is also an (unpublished) article describing the mathematics behind the design of such wheels [here](http://pureza.github.io/doc/article.pdf).
